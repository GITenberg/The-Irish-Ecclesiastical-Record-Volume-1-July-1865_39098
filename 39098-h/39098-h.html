        Doctrines.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have read the
        address of Mr. Justice Keogh<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=
        "#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> with
        feelings of surprise and sorrow. It is un-Catholic in its language,
        it is un-Catholic in its spirit, it is un-Catholic in its principles.
        If it had come from a member of a hostile sect, we could well afford
        to let it pass unnoticed; to let it live its short life, and die a
        natural death. But when the calumnies, the sneers, the sarcasms of
        our enemies are turned against us by one who is enrolled under the
        banner of Catholic faith, we can no longer remain silent in safety.
        The weapons which are powerless in the hands of a declared enemy, are
        dangerous indeed when they are wielded by a traitor in the camp.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Justice Keogh
        is no ordinary man. His mind is adorned with talents well fitted to
        amuse, to delight, to instruct an audience. In his short but
        brilliant career as an orator and a statesman, he won for himself a
        great name at the bar and in the senate. And now he is lifted up
        above his fellows, and placed in a position of high trust and
        extensive influence. When such a man comes forward, with forethought
        and preparation, as one of the instructors of the age, he is a
        conspicuous object of interest and attraction. He is looked upon, by
        those who are not acquainted with his antecedents, as the exponent of
        Catholic views, the representative of Catholic intelligence and
        education. We are therefore compelled, in self-defence, to declare
        that the opinions he has expressed are not the opinions of the
        Catholic Church, and the language he has thought fit to use cannot be
        regarded, by the Catholic people of Ireland, but as offensive and
        insulting.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His lecture
        contains little originality of thought or novelty of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a name="Pg450" id="Pg450"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> argument. It does but reflect the spirit
        of the age in which we live. The opinions and the views which it sets
        forth have long been familiar to our ears: they pervade the shallow
        current literature of England, of Germany, of Italy, of France.
        Intellectual freedom, unbounded, unrestrained; freedom of thought in
        the search after truth, without any regard to authority; freedom of
        speech in the circulation of every view and opinion; freedom to pull
        down old theories, freedom to build up new theories; freedom to roam
        at large without any guide over the vast fields of speculation,
        adopting that which private judgment commends, rejecting that which
        human reason disapproves; these are the popular dogmas of the present
        day; and these are the topics which Mr. Justice Keogh proposes to
        illustrate and to enforce by the life and writings of our great
        English poet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, we are not
        the enemies of freedom. The Catholic Church is not the enemy of
        freedom. But we should expect that one who comes forward to enlighten
        the world on this important subject, would tell us <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how far</span></em>
        human reason is to be left without restraint in the search after
        truth. It is easy to talk of intolerance, persecution, narrow-minded
        bigotry; but these words have no meaning unless we first clearly
        understand what that freedom is—in thought, in word, in action—which
        is the natural right of all men; which it is intolerance to deny,
        which it is tyranny to extinguish. First of all, if the fact of a
        Divine Revelation be once admitted, it is clear that human reason is
        not exempt from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">all restraint</span></em>: it must be controlled
        at least by the Word of God. We are surely bound to believe what God
        has taught: and when reason would lead us to conclusions contrary to
        His teaching, as may sometimes happen, we are bound to check our
        reason and to abandon those conclusions. For, reason <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em> be
        deceived, but God can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em>. This is what we understand by
        the words of St. Paul when he speaks of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“bringing into captivity every understanding unto the
        obedience of Christ”</span>—II. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Cor.</span></span>, x. 5.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this
        preliminary remark we shall now submit to our readers the opinions of
        Mr. Justice Keogh:—</p>

          language which is affecting the fate of millions, even at this
          hour, on the banks of the Mississippi, and in the remote forests of
          the far west, that He who has made 'of one blood all nations of men

          shall tempt you to approach these considerations, to ponder upon
          them as they are to be found in the tractates of Milton, in a
          tranquil, in a large and comprehensive spirit, and when you have
          done so, to make their fit application not only at home but abroad,
          not only abroad but at home, then we shall not have met in vain in

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We do not propose
        to offer any remarks on the subject of political liberty. But the
        principles here enunciated are of universal application. Milton waged
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“successful war”</span> of freedom not
        less in matters of religion than in matters of state. And Mr. Justice
        Keogh adopts his principles without any limitation. He asserts with
        Milton <span class="tei tei-q">“the right of all men to exercise
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unrestrained their intellectual faculties upon
        all the gifts of God</span></em>—to determine for themselves what is
        truth and what is falsehood”</span>. If we take these words literally
        as they stand, they are inconsistent not with the Catholic religion
        only, but with every system of Christianity that has ever existed.
        Luther, the great champion of intellectual freedom, though he shook
        off the yoke of church authority, set up in its stead the authority
        of the Bible. Even he was willing to admit that the wanderings of the
        human mind should be restricted by the teaching of the Word of God.
        It is clearly contrary to the common principles of Christianity to
        assert that in metaphysics, in ethics, in psychology, in any human
        science, the mind is at liberty to embrace opinions incompatible with
        the truths which God has revealed. And if it be not at liberty to do
        so, then it is not <span class="tei tei-q">“unrestrained”</span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be said,
        however, that the author of this address does not really intend to
        assert what his words seem to convey. How then are we to guess at his
        meaning? He insists upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg
        452]</span><a name="Pg452" id="Pg452" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the right of all men to exercise <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unrestrained</span></em> their intellectual
        faculties”</span> in the pursuit of truth. If he does not mean this,
        what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">does</span></em> he mean? If he does not wish to
        exclude <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all
        restraint</span></em> on the <span class="tei tei-q">“intellectual
        faculties”</span> of men, what restraint is he willing to admit? Upon
        this point there seem to be just two opinions between which he has to
        choose: the one is the common doctrine of all Catholics; the other is
        the fundamental principle of the Protestant Church. Let us pause for
        a moment to examine these two systems.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
        Catholic faith, our Divine Lord has established in His Church an
        infallible tribunal, to pronounce, in matters of religion, what is
        true and what is false. Hence, it is never lawful, whether there be
        question of religious belief or of human science, to adopt opinions
        at variance with the teaching of this infallible tribunal. Here
        indeed is a check upon intellectual freedom, but a check which must,
        of necessity, be admitted by all who belong to the Catholic Church.
        And surely it is no great sacrifice to submit our finite
        understanding, so frail and erring, to the authority of God's Word,
        explained by a tribunal which He has Himself established, and to
        which He has promised His never-failing help.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Protestants, on
        the other hand, maintain the right of each one to interpret for
        himself, according to the best of his private judgment, the
        Revelation which God has given to man. The liberty of the human mind
        is therefore unfettered by any human authority. In this all sects are
        agreed. Some, indeed, believe that the Church has authority to teach,
        and some reject this opinion; but all maintain that there is no
        obligation in conscience to accept her teaching. She has not the gift
        of infallibility. Just as individuals may fall into error, so too may
        the Church herself fall into error. Her teaching may be true, or it
        may be false; each one is to judge for himself. The only check upon
        the freedom of thought is the Divine Message sent to us from on High,
        and recorded in the pages of Holy Writ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We maintain, of
        course, that the Catholic system which we have just explained is
        true, and the Protestant system false. If we were engaged in
        controversy with a Protestant, it would be our duty at once to
        establish and to defend our doctrine; to demonstrate that the Church
        of Christ is infallible, and that the right of private judgment is
        contrary alike to the teaching of Scripture and to the dictates of
        common sense. But in the case before us, there is no call for proof:
        Mr. Justice Keogh is a Catholic. It remains then only to examine if
        the language of his address is not calculated to convey an opinion
        quite inconsistent with the faith which he professes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question we
        wish to raise is simply this: <span class="tei tei-q">“Does the
        address <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a name=
        "Pg453" id="Pg453" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> before us admit that
        the human mind in the pursuit of truth should be restrained by the
        authoritative definitions of the Catholic Church, or does it rather
        exclude this restraint?”</span> Now, in the first place, it is to be
        remembered that this restriction of intellectual freedom is denied by
        all Protestants in this country, and maintained by all Catholics.
        When a lecturer, then, addressing a mixed audience, in a written
        discourse, tells them that <span class="tei tei-q">“all men have a
        right to exercise their intellectual faculties <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unrestrained</span></em>”</span>, do not the
        circumstances of the case fix upon his words a Protestant
        signification? Will not his hearers naturally say that he has chosen
        the Protestant side of the controversy, and not the Catholic? Again,
        according to the Protestant doctrine, each one is at liberty to
        construct a system of religious belief for himself: according to the
        Catholic doctrine, every one should accept the tenets of his faith on
        the authority of the Church. Now we are told in the address, that all
        men have <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a right to determine
        for themselves</span></em> what is truth and what is
        falsehood”</span>. Has this phraseology a Catholic or a Protestant
        complexion? Lastly, the lecturer exhorts his hearers to go themselves
        to the pages of Milton, there to learn the doctrine of intellectual
        freedom. It will, therefore, naturally be supposed, that the doctrine
        is defended by the lecturer in the same sense in which it is defended
        by the poet. Now Milton denied again and again, not in his writings
        only, but also by his acts, that the Church has any right to
        interfere with the speculations of the human mind. It is evident,
        therefore, that the language of Mr. Justice Keogh, whether considered
        in itself, or understood by the light of the context, is incompatible
        with the principles of the Catholic Religion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Freedom of thought
        is not enough: freedom of speech is also an essential dogma of the
        new philosophy. We are assured that all men have a right <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“to circulate their thoughts from one to another, from
        land to land, from tribe to tribe, from nation to nation, free as
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘the winds that from four quarters
        blow’</span>; to raise their thoughts, and to pour forth their words
        above the level of vulgar superstition, unrestricted by any illiberal
        or illiterate licenser”</span>. Accordingly, amongst the various
        prose works of Milton, there is one which our lecturer selects for
        especial commendation. It is entitled: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Areopagitica, a Speech
        for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing</span></span>. This little
        tract is distinguished, no doubt, for its learning, wit, and
        eloquence; but these high qualities are devoted to the defence of
        opinions which we cannot accept. The book and its principles are thus
        introduced to his audience by Mr. Justice Keogh:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

          and I would boldly maintain, not only that he had satisfied every
          call which his country could make on the most devoted of her sons,
          but that he had vindicated their rights and sustained his own
          reputation in the greatest pen writing in the English language. He
          wished, as he tells us in this treatise, to deliver the press from
          the restraints with which it was incumbered, that the power of
          determining what ought to be published and what suppressed, might
          no longer be entrusted to captious lawyers or knavish priests, or
          even grave chancellors and venerable chief justices.... I shall
          give you, even at the risk of trying your patience, some extracts
          from this treatise; but first let me tell you, that it establishes
          in the clearest way, not only that Milton was the fast friend of
          toleration, but that the charges of being an enemy of all order and
          of all monarchy, so industriously made against him, are without
          foundation.... And then he gives expression to this noble
          sentiment, fit to be engraven in letters of gold. Let statesmen
          hear it, and tyrants, civil and ecclesiastical, dwell upon
          it:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Although I
          dispraise not the defence of just immunities, yet love my peace
          better, if that were all, give me the liberty to know, to utter,
          and to argue freely, according to conscience, above all
          liberties</span><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. I
          cannot bring myself to hurry over this noble tract. I have read it
          over again and again; I read it years and years ago, and often
          since, and now again, for the purpose of addressing you; and the
          oftener I read it, the more I take it to my heart. If such be its
          effect upon me, as I fondly hope it may be upon many of
          you</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">, etc.</span>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
        this ardent and enthusiastic declaration, we yet think it would be
        unfair to impute to the learned lecturer every casual expression or
        even every deliberate opinion set forth in the speech he so much
        admires. It is, however, clear that he adopts as his own at least the
        main features of the doctrine enunciated, and the general character
        of the argument by which it is defended. This doctrine may be
        explained in two words: unbounded liberty, on the one hand, to
        publish and to circulate all manner of opinions; unbounded liberty,
        on the other, to read all manner of books. The State, it is
        contended, has no right to forbid, or to repress, those publications
        which are dangerous to the welfare of society; neither has the Church
        a right to forbid or to repress those publications which are hostile
        to the spiritual interests of the faithful. These views we believe to
        be false and pernicious both as regards the power of the State and
        the power of the Church. It is, however, under the latter aspect
        alone that we propose to consider the subject.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pastors of the
        Church have received a divine command to guard the integrity of faith
        and to watch over the purity of morals. Therefore have they also
        received from God that authority which is necessary for the due
        fulfilment of this high charge. And such is the authority to prohibit
        and, as far as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg
        455]</span><a name="Pg455" id="Pg455" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> may
        be, to repress those publications of which the only tendency is to
        introduce error and to disseminate vice. For it is impossible to
        preserve truth incorrupt in a community, if error may be circulated
        without restriction, dressed up in the delusive garb of sophistry; it
        is impossible to preserve morals pure, if vice may be freely
        exhibited in the most seductive and alluring forms. A great writer
        and a wise philosopher, Samuel Johnson, even though a Protestant, had
        the vigour of mind to seize this important principle, which he has
        expressed with a singular felicity of diction and an epigrammatic
        power peculiarly his own: <span class="tei tei-q">“If every murmurer
        at government”</span>, he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“may diffuse
        discontent, there can be no peace; and if every sceptic in theology
        may teach his follies, there can be no religion”</span>.<a id=
        "noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We confess indeed
        that this is a question full of difficulty to members of the
        Protestant Church. They believe that each one has a right to judge
        for himself what is true and what is false: and it is not easy to see
        how this right can be exercised, unless each one be free to examine
        every form of belief, every variety of error. But we are at a loss to
        understand how a Catholic should go astray on a subject so plain.
        From the earliest ages the Catholic Church has ever claimed and
        exercised the right to condemn and prohibit those books which are
        contrary to faith and dangerous to morals. Now it would be an error
        in doctrine to suppose that the Catholic Church could claim such a
        right if she had not received it from her Divine Founder.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we pass from
        the doctrine of Milton to his arguments, we shall have much greater
        reason to wonder how it should have come to pass that we are asked,
        by a Catholic lecturer, to accept his views. He does not defend the
        circulation of bad books as a necessary evil, which it is inexpedient
        or impossible to check. On the contrary, he maintains it is a
        positive good, which ought to be encouraged. According to his notion,
        the promiscuous reading of bad books is the furnace in which our love
        for truth and virtue is to be tried. There can be no merit in truth,
        he argues, for him who is not acquainted with error; there can be no
        merit in virtue for him who is not familiar with vice. These are
        sentiments so utterly repugnant to the common instincts of our
        nature, that we could not believe they came from our illustrious
        poet, if his own words did not bear witness against him:—</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

        the state of man now is, what wisdom can there he to choose, what
        continence to forbear, without the knowledge of evil? He that can
        apprehend and consider vice with all her baits and seeming pleasures,
        and yet abstain, and yet distinguish, and yet prefer that which is
        truly better, he is the true wayfaring Christian. I cannot praise a
        fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and unbreathed,</span>
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a name="Pg456"

          but slinks out of the race, where that immortal garland is to be
          run for notwithstanding dust and heat. Assuredly we bring not
          innocence into the world; we bring impurity much rather: that which
          purifies us is trial, and trial is by what is contrary. That
          virtue, therefore, which is but a youngling in the contemplation of
          evil, and knows not the utmost that vice promises to her followers,
          and rejects it, is but a blank virtue, not a pure.... Since
          therefore the knowledge and survey of vice is in this world so
          necessary to the constituting of human virtue, and the scanning of
          error to the confirmation of truth, how can we more safely and with
          less danger scout into the regions of sin and falsity, than by
          reading all manner of tractates, and hearing all manner of reason?

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We shall offer no
        commentary on this passage. Principles like these carry with them
        their own condemnation. And yet such are the principles advanced in a

        Keogh, that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Justice Keogh would hold up to the
        admiration of his audience! Here is <span class="tei tei-q">“the fast
        friend of toleration”</span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the staunchest
        friend of freedom and truth that ever lived”</span>, the man who
        <span class="tei tei-q">“has made the most successful war against
        tyranny and falsehood”</span>! We must charitably suppose that the
        learned lecturer has formed his opinion of Milton without reading his
        works.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are told by the
        biographers of Milton that his father, who was the son of a zealous
        Roman Catholic, abandoned the religion of his ancestors, and was on
        that account deprived of his inheritance. The act of apostasy is one
        that the Catholic Church can never contemplate without the deepest
        sorrow and abhorrence. According to the principles of our faith, he
        who separates himself from the one True Church transgresses the
        command of God and forfeits his claim to everlasting happiness. Yet,
        it would seem, Mr. Justice Keogh finds in this act nothing to
        deplore, but much to admire. Speaking of the poet, he says:—</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">He was in early
        youth instructed by a father who had sacrificed for conscience' sake
        a fair inheritance, with all scriptural lore, of which he drank with
        a thirst which was never satisfied</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.</span>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we understand
        these words aright, our author regards with complacency the conduct
        of one who renounced the true faith, to embrace a religion which, in
        the eyes of all Catholics, is false and heretical. To his mind the
        act of apostasy is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a sacrifice for conscience' sake</span></em>.
        This is liberality of sentiment indeed! But it is a liberality of
        sentiment which we cannot reconcile with the maxims of sacred
        Scripture. Not so did the great apostle speak of those who had
        <span class="tei tei-q">“made shipwreck concerning the faith”</span>.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Of whom”</span>, he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered up to
        Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme”</span>—I. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tim.</span></span>, i.
        19. 20. And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“And their speech
        spreadeth like a canker; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have
        erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is past
        already”</span>—II. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Tim.</span></span>, ii. 17, 18.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our readers,
        perhaps, will not be unwilling to know what was the effect of this
        training on the religious principles of Milton. His rich and vigorous
        mind was, indeed, a fertile soil. The seed which was sown in the
        spring time of youth, did not fail to grow up into a luxuriant tree,
        and to bring forth fruit in due season, according to its kind. In the
        maturity of life he constructed a system of theology which he
        professed to derive from Scripture alone. It is recorded by his own
        pen in his treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">De Doctrina Christiana</span></span>, which,
        having been lost for a hundred and fifty years, has come to light
        within the present century. The peculiar tenets which he sets forth
        in this remarkable book may be briefly told. He defends the
        lawfulness of polygamy and divorce; he <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page458">[pg 458]</span><a name="Pg458" id="Pg458" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> maintains that matter exists from eternity; he
        denies the doctrine of the Trinity; the Son is inferior to the
        Father, and produced in time; the Holy Ghost is inferior to the
        Father and the Son. An able writer has described <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the result of the whole work”</span> as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a system of theology not merely in discordance with the
        Church of England, but with every sect by which we are divided; an
        incoherent and conflicting theory, which combines Arianism,
        Anabaptism, Latitudinarianism, Quakerism, and we know not what to
        add, on account of his opinions on polygamy, but
        Mahometanism”</span>.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href=
        "#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> These
        results are the ripe fruit of that early instruction in <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“all Scriptural lore”</span> which Milton received, and
        for which Mr. Justice Keogh would seek our sympathy and approval.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After what we have
        seen, we cannot be surprised that our learned lecturer should point
        the finger of scorn and ridicule at the Roman Inquisition. Speaking
        of Milton's travels in Italy, he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“There
        it was his fortune to visit Gallileo, confined in the prison of the
        Inquisition for thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan
        and Dominican believers”</span>. We do not propose here to defend the
        Inquisition: neither shall we attempt to disprove the charge, which
        Mr. Justice Keogh would fain convey, that the Catholic Church is the
        enemy of scientific truth. We shall wait for an adversary who deals
        in arguments and not in sneers. We cannot, however, forbear to notice
        a gross inaccuracy in the statement of fact. It is asserted that it
        was the fortune of Milton <span class="tei tei-q">“to visit Gallileo
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">confined in
        the prison of the Inquisition</span></em>”</span>. This assertion is
        simply false. Milton's visit must have occurred about the year 1638,
        and it is well known to all who are acquainted with the subject, that
        Gallileo was then living at home in his own house at Arcetri, quietly
        pursuing his astronomical studies. In point of law, indeed, he was
        still technically a prisoner of the Inquisition, but this is widely
        different from being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">confined in the prison of the
        Inquisition</span></em>. It is only fair to observe that the words of
        Milton himself, from whom the lecturer has taken his statement, are,
        on this point, strictly correct. <span class="tei tei-q">“There it
        was that I found and visited the famous Gallileo, grown old,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a prisoner
        to the Inquisition</span></em>, for thinking in astronomy otherwise
        than the Franciscan and Dominican licensers thought”</span>.<a id=
        "noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> Our
        lecturer, therefore, in borrowing the language of the poet, has not
        only contrived to introduce an error, but he has taken care that this
        error shall be on the side most unfavourable to the Catholic
        Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We shall not
        trouble the reader with our own views or arguments on the hackneyed
        controversy of Gallileo's persecution. We shall be content to
        contrast the opinion of Mr. Justice Keogh with that of a learned and
        able Protestant writer, who has devoted <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page459">[pg 459]</span><a name="Pg459" id="Pg459" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> much study to the life and times of the great
        astronomer, and who is himself honourably distinguished in kindred
        fields of science. Sir David Brewster, with all his strong
        anti-Catholic prejudices, distinctly maintains that the trials of
        Gallileo, such as they were, are not to be ascribed to his opinions
        in matters of astronomy, but rather to his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“personal imprudence”</span> and to his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“irreligious sentiments”</span>.<a id="noteref_10" name=
        "noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> The
        character of the persecution which he had to endure at the hands of
        the Catholic Church may be gathered from the testimony of the same
        eminent writer. In the year 1623, long after he had been tried before
        the tribunal of the Inquisition, having occasion to come to Rome, he
        met with a noble and generous reception from the Father of the
        faithful. <span class="tei tei-q">“The kindness of his
        Holiness”</span>, says Sir David Brewster, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“was of the most marked description. He not only loaded
        Gallileo with presents, and promised him a pension for his son
        Vincenzo, but wrote a letter to Ferdinand II., who had just succeeded
        Cosmo as Grand Duke of Tuscany, recommending Gallileo to his
        particular patronage”</span>.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11"
        href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> And
        again he says:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

        <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Thus honoured
        by the head of the Church, and befriended by its dignitaries,
        Gallileo must have felt himself secure against the indignities of its
        lesser functionaries.... But Gallileo was bound to the Romish
        hierarchy by even stronger ties. His son and himself were pensioners
        of the Church; and having accepted of its alms, they owed it at least
        a decent and respectful allegiance. The pension thus given by Urban
        was not a remuneration which sovereigns sometimes award to the
        services of their subjects. Gallileo was a foreigner at Rome. The
        sovereign of the Papal state owed him no obligation; and hence we
        must regard the pension of Gallileo as</span> <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a
        donation from the Roman Pontiff to science

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are many
        other blots in the address of Mr. Justice Keogh, which a severe
        critic would not pass by without censure. He would ask, perhaps, how
        comes it that the lecturer takes his Scriptural quotations from the
        Protestant and not from the Catholic Bible? Is it that the Protestant
        Bible is the only one with which he is familiar? Can it be that the
        Protestant Bible is the source from which he derives his views in
        philosophy and in theology? We fully recognize the literary merits of
        the English Authorized Version; but there can be no doubt that the
        religious prejudices of its authors have led them into many serious
        errors. At all events it is not usual for a Catholic to quote from
        its pages <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg
        460]</span><a name="Pg460" id="Pg460" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        without some apology or some explanation. Again, why does he tell his
        audience that the names of Spenser, of Shakespeare, of Scott, are to
        be found on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Index Expurgatorius</span></span>? Did he
        consult the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Index</span></span> himself and find these names
        upon it? It cannot be: they are not there. Was he induced to make the
        assertion on the authority of some trustworthy witness? We can
        scarcely believe it was so: no writer who cares for his reputation
        would commit himself to a statement so easily disproved. Was it,
        then, that he wished to cast unfounded aspersions on the Catholic
        Church, and to bring her institutions into discredit with all who
        cherish the names of those illustrious writers? Once more: Mr.
        Justice Keogh, forgetting, for the moment, his country as well as his
        religion, introduces to the favourable notice of his audience
        <span class="tei tei-q">“our glorious deliverer, William
        III.”</span>! What a startling phrase to hear from the lips of an
        Irishman and a Catholic! William III. possessed many eminent
        qualities: he was a brave soldier and an able statesmen. But in the
        annals of Ireland his name must be for ever associated with
        persecution and with perfidy.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13"
        href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a name="Pg461" id="Pg461" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our limited space
        is now drawing to a close; and, in good truth, we are weary of
        passing censure. It is time that we lift up our eyes from the right
        honourable lecturer to fix them for a few moments on the more noble
        and majestic proportions of the great poet himself. When we
        contemplate that venerable figure, as it stands forth to view on the
        canvas of history, if we speak in the language of censure, it must be
        blended with the language of genuine love and veneration. His errors
        we cannot defend; his faults we do not wish to extenuate; we are
        obliged to protest against his principles, and those who eulogise
        them. But amidst the varied fortunes of his chequered career he
        displayed many great qualities, which cannot fail to win the
        admiration of every generous heart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of his public
        conduct as a statesman we cannot indeed speak with approval. It seems
        to us that all the arguments advanced in his defence carry with them
        also his condemnation. He sided with the parliament against the king,
        because, it is said, he wished to uphold the constitution of his
        country; and yet he defended the trial and execution of the king,
        which were conducted in defiance of that same constitution. He
        abandoned his lawful sovereign to support the fortunes of Cromwell,
        because he believed that Charles was a despot; and yet he clung to
        the cause of Cromwell when Cromwell was not only a despot but an
        usurper. If the constitution was to be upheld, then the execution of
        the king was indefensible. If a tyrant should forfeit the allegiance
        of his subjects, then Cromwell had no claim to be obeyed. Yet however
        much he erred, it must be ever borne in mind that those who took a
        part in the turbulent events of the great rebellion, had not the same
        opportunities to form a calm and impartial judgment which we now
        possess. Men distinguished by great vigour of mind and great public
        spirit, were to be found on opposite sides in the senate and in the
        camp. None could have told, when the breach first appeared between
        Charles and his parliament, that it would lead to civil war and end
        in the crime of regicide. It was necessary to make a choice; and the
        choice once made, it required more than ordinary virtue, more than
        ordinary courage, to recede; virtue and courage with which Milton was
        not endowed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those, however,
        who would form a just estimate of Milton's character must seek him
        far away from the din of war and the strife of parties. He had borne
        a conspicuous part in a memorable political struggle; his fame had
        been carried abroad to distant lands; and yet he retires without
        regret from public life, to commune with his own mind in the
        obscurity of an humble lodging. The world admires the magnanimity of
        the old Roman who, having saved his country from destruction,
        returned again <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg
        462]</span><a name="Pg462" id="Pg462" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        his plough and to the simple pleasures of his rustic home. But there
        is far more to admire in the closing period of Milton's career. The
        hour of his prosperity had passed away; the vigour of youth was gone.
        Disappointed in his hopes, neglected by an age unworthy of his
        genius, poor, and blind, and old, his splendid mind rose superior to
        all these calamities, which would have crushed a less noble spirit.
        As if now, at length, released from the captivity of earthly bonds,
        he soars aloft to higher thoughts, and pours forth from an
        overflowing soul the lofty strains of his unrivalled poem, the glory
        of English literature, the wonder and delight of every succeeding
        age. Not often does the history of the world present to us a
        spectacle so sublime.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet how little
        does genius avail in the one great and important affair of religion,
        unless guided and controlled by that infallible authority which God
        has established in His Church! The great doctrinal errors of Milton
        cannot be imputed to any want of intellectual power; for, in the
        natural gifts of intellect, he was eminently conspicuous. Much rather
        must they be ascribed to the erroneous system he employed in the
        search of Revealed truth. Starting from false principles, the more
        boldly he advanced, the more deeply did he plunge into error. In
        common with other Protestants, he accepted the doctrine of private
        judgment; but he was distinguished from others by the logical
        consistency and inflexible resolution with which he ever clung to
        this fundamental principle. Having been taught not to subject his
        reason to the authority of a Church which claimed to be infallible,
        he refused to submit to the teaching of a Church which had renounced
        that claim. His errors were more extravagant than those of other
        Protestant writers, only because he was more fearless in his
        speculations, more consistent in his principles, more honest in his
        speech. Others are often saved from error because they hesitate to
        follow the light of reason, when reason would lead them too far from
        the beaten track of received opinions. But such timidity and
        inconsistency were little in harmony with the spirit of Milton. He
        had learned in early youth, as a first principle, that, in the matter
        of religion, Scripture should be his only authority, reason his only
        guide; and in after life he was ever prepared to follow that guide
        whithersoever it might conduct.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The religious
        career of Milton appears to us, therefore, in a remarkable manner, at
        once to illustrate and to disprove the Protestant <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rule of
        Faith</span></em>. In him it was fairly tried, and it was found
        wanting. It would be difficult, we believe, to select from the whole
        range of Protestant writers any one who possessed in a higher degree,
        those qualities which are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg
        463]</span><a name="Pg463" id="Pg463" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        favourable to the exercise of private judgment. His distinguished
        biographer, Mr. Mitford, who was himself a Protestant clergyman, has
        spoken on this subject with great candour and ability. Referring to
        the treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">De Doctrina Christiana</span></span>, he
        says:—</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It is
        acknowledged by all that it is written with a calm and conscientious
        desire for truth, like that of a man who had forgotten or dismissed
        the favourite animosities of his youth, and who had retired within
        himself, in the dignity of age, to employ the unimpaired energies of
        his intellect on the most important and awful subject of inquiry. The
        haughtiness of his temper, the defiance of his manner, his severe and
        stoical pride, are no longer seen. He approaches the book of God with

        was as a little child <span class="tei tei-q">“tossed to and fro, and
        carried about with every wind of doctrine”</span>. He wandered, we
        are told, <span class="tei tei-q">“from Puritanism to Calvinism, from
        Calvinism to an esteem for Arminius, and finally, from an accordance
        with the Independents and Anabaptists to a dereliction of every

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems to us,
        therefore, that we can find some excuse for the errors of Milton in
        the false principles which he had imbibed in his youth. And, with all
        his faults, we cannot but revere the magnanimity of his spirit, the
        splendour of his genius. But we have no sympathy with those who,
        having the rich inheritance of an infallible authority for their
        guide in matters of religion, would yet claim for themselves the
        right to launch forth into the boundless sea of thought without
        restriction or restraint; who blindly embrace the conclusions of
        Milton, while they reject his premises; and who imitate him in his
        wanderings, while they cannot imitate that nobility of sentiment and
        that loftiness of eloquence which shed a lustre even around his
        errors.</p>

        Century.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the year 1463,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Matthew</span></span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mahoun
        O'Griffa</span></span> was appointed by Pope Pius II., Bishop of
        Killaloe. He had hitherto held the canonry and prebend of
        Teampul-monin, in the diocese of Limerick, the annual revenue of
        which amounted to twenty marks, and the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monumenta
        Vaticana</span></span> preserve an interesting fragment, which
        records the appointment of Donald Magillapadrig as his successor in
        that dignity: <span class="tei tei-q">“Confertur ipsi canonicatus et
        prebenda de Tampolmonin in Ecclesia Limericensi quorum fructus
        viginti marcharum sterlingorum non excedunt et quos Mattheus electus
        Laonensis tempore suae promotionis obtinebat”</span> (17 Decemb.,
        1463; pag. 455).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. O'Griffa died
        in 1482, and was succeeded the same year by Terence O'Brien, who
        ruled the see for forty-three years, and, as Ware informs us,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“was a prelate of great account among his
        people for his liberality and hospitality”</span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Richard Hogan, a
        Franciscan, was chosen his successor in 1525, and after an episcopate
        of fourteen years, was translated to Clonmacnoise by Pope Paul III.,
        on 16th June, 1539. He, however, enjoyed this new dignity only for a
        little while, as, a few days after his translation, he was summoned
        to his eternal reward.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is remarkable
        that the episcopate of his successor in the see of Killaloe was
        equally short; for, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        of Clonmacnoise and Killaloe on 15th December, 1539, the union of
        these sees being at the same time limited to the lifetime of this
        bishop. The following is the consistorial entry:—</p>

        episcopate was marked by many signal events, and his zeal in the
        defence of the Catholic faith merited for him the hatred of the
        enemies of our holy Church. He died in 1554, and had for his
        successor Terence O'Brien, who received his appointment in the
        beginning of Queen Mary's reign, and continued <span class=

        Francis.</span></span>); and on 22nd of August, 1576, his translation
        to Kilmacduagh was solemnly promulgated in the Roman court.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His successor,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cornelius
        O'Melrian</span></span>, O.S.F., was appointed the same month, viz.,
        26th August, 1576, and for forty-one years, till his death in 1617,
        he continued bishop of this ancient see. This prelate played an
        important part in the last great struggle of the Desmond chieftains;
        and we have intentionally passed rapidly over the preceding bishops,
        that space might remain for dwelling on the unpublished documents
        connected with his history. At the time of his appointment to the see
        of Killaloe, James Fitzmaurice was actively engaged on the Continent
        in enlisting the aid of the Catholic powers in favour of the Irish
        confederates. Before setting sail from Lisbon on 30th October, 1577,
        this chieftain wrote to Gaspar de Quiroza, Archbishop of Toledo,
        acquainting him with the disaster which had befallen our Bishop
        Cornelius, who, a little while before, having sailed from Rochelle
        for the Irish coast, was captured by pirates, and being despoiled of
        all he possessed, was obliged to return to the Continent. Fitzmaurice
        adds:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When at length a
        considerable body of Spanish troops set sail for Ireland, under the
        command of the unfortunate colonel St. José, the bishop of Killaloe
        accompanied them, but soon quitted their ranks to join the Irish camp
        and assist the native Desmond princes by his sacred ministry and
        counsel. In 1582 he was instructed by the Earl of Desmond to proceed
        to Spain and Rome, and negotiate whatever measures might tend to the
        succour of Ireland. The following letters addressed by this Irish
        chieftain to the reigning pontiff Gregory XIII., will be read with
        interest by all who are acquainted with that sad period of our
        history; they are extracted from the Vatican archives:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Vatican
        archives is also preserved a series of letters of our bishop
        Cornelius, addressed to Rome in the years 1582, 1583, and 1584. They
        are all connected with the diplomatic mission which he received from
        the Geraldine princes, and some of them throw considerable light on
        the contemporary civil and ecclesiastical history of our island.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before, however,
        we present them to the reader, we deem it <span class="tei tei-pb"

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> necessary to remark that the relations of our
        bishops and of the Holy See with the native princes during the wars
        of Elizabeth's reign have often been misconstrued, in the writings of
        those who were led away by the frenzy of political agitation. The
        Irish chieftains had at this period the title and privileges of
        independent princes; and as such they were entitled to defend with
        the sword those religious and civil rights which the government of
        Elizabeth attempted to destroy. Hence, their struggle merited the
        sympathy of the Holy See and the blessing of our martyr-clergy. But
        far more distant than heaven is from earth were the chivalry of James
        Fitzmaurice and the heroism of Hugh O'Neill from that accursed Fenian
        blight which, alas! has now-a-days fallen upon some of our benighted
        and deluded countrymen!</p>

          Catholica praestitit nobis magnam summam pecuniarum, armorum et

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the last
        letter we have met with from the illustrious Bishop of Killaloe, Dr.
        O'Melrian. His episcopate continued till 1617; yet the only event
        recorded concerning him during this long interval is his having
        examined the work of Stanihurst, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Moribus et Rebus
        Hiberniae</span></span>, and on the margin opposite each error his

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
        bishops of the Establishment, that of <span class=

        Curyn</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Corrin</span></span>, seems to have been the
        first appointment made by King Henry VIII. Some call him Bishop of
        Killaloe as early as 1529, during the episcopate of Dr. Hogan; others
        date his appointment from 1539/40. At all events it is probable he is
        the bishop that is referred to in the letter of Dr. Browne to Lord
        Cromwell on 16th February, 1539/40, when he complains that the Lord
        Deputy <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
        O'Brien's country</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“deposed a
        bishop who was promoted by the king's highness, ... and he that the
        Lord Deputy hath now promoted to the same is a Gray Friar (Dr.
        O'Kirwan), one of the holy confessors of the late Garrantys, even as
        rank a traitor as ever they were”</span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">State
        Papers</span></span>, iii. 123). Dr. Corrin resigned the see in 1546,
        and Cornelius O'Dea was appointed by the king in July, the same year,
        and, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page477">[pg 477]</span><a name=
        "Pg477" id="Pg477" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as Ware tells us, he
        held the see about nine years. The next crown nominee was Moriertach
        O'Brien. Though appointed by Queen Elizabeth in 1570, he was for a
        long time content with the enjoyment of the temporalities of the see,
        and it was only in 1577 that he received episcopal consecration. John
        Rider, the next Protestant bishop, was appointed in 1612: he is
        chiefly remarkable for a Latin dictionary which he compiled, and in
        which he was accused of taking both the substance and words from the
        Lexicon of Thomas Thomatius.</p>

        those who are now called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">confessors</span></em>, whose mission it is to
        receive the confessions of the faithful and to heal by the sacrament
        of penance, the spiritual wounds inflicted on the soul after baptism.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Sure we are”</span>, writes Usher,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that it was the custom of the faithful in
        our ancient Church, to confess their sins to the priests, that they
        might be made partakers of the benefit of the keys for the quieting
        of their troubled consciences”</span>—<span class=

        Religion, etc.</span></span>, p. 46.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our old
        commentator, Claudius, more than once repeats this doctrine, and
        teaches that the power of forgiving sins was granted by the divine
        Redeemer to His apostles and their successors in the priesthood:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The power of loosing and binding”</span>, he
        says, <span class="tei tei-q">“was granted to all the apostles by our
        Saviour, when, appearing to them after His resurrection, He breathed
        upon them, and said: Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins you shall
        forgive, they are forgiven, and whose sins you shall retain, they are
        retained. Even to the present day this duty devolves upon the Church
        in its bishops and priests, and having examined each sinner's cause,
        they absolve those whom they find humble and truly penitent, from the
        fear of eternal death, but such as they find to persist in their
        sins, these are bound down unto never-ending
        torments”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">In Matth. Codex Vatican.</span></span>, fol.
        149, b.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Elsewhere,
        expounding the history of the man who was sick with the palsy, he
        remarks: <span class="tei tei-q">“The scribes say truly that none can
        forgive sins save God alone, who also it is that forgives through
        those to whom he has given the power of forgiving”</span>. And again,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“St. John teaches us, in regard to the
        remission of sins, that our Saviour after His resurrection promised
        to His disciples <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478">[pg
        478]</span><a name="Pg478" id="Pg478" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        loosened whom they shall loosen”</span>—<span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old
        penitential canons of our Church will serve as a practical commentary
        on these texts of Claudius. Thus, in the synod held by our apostle,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the ancient
        collection of canons made for the use of our Irish Church about the
        year 700, there is one book (the 48th) entitled <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de
        Poenitentia</span></span>. The thirty-three chapters into which it is
        divided are for the most part moral or disciplinary: as, for
        instance, the twenty-fifth chapter, which enjoins that all penitents
        should receive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">imposition of hands</span></em> from the priests
        during Lent, moreover, should carry the dead to the place of
        sepulture, and there inter them, and, in fine, should present
        themselves kneeling at all the functions of the Church from Easter to
        Pentecost. There are, however, some incidental passages which
        beautifully illustrate the idea entertained by our fathers of the
        necessity and advantages of sacramental confession. Thus in the third
        chapter the words of St. Augustine are adopted:</p>

        has contracted by sinning; let him by satisfaction wash away the
        stains which defile his soul; let him by vigilance supply for his
        former neglect; let him for the future be a follower of Christ by
        virtuous deeds, as hitherto he had followed Satan by his sins; and he

        confession is made unto salvation. He who conceals his sins cannot be
        directed; but he who confesses them and relinquishes them all, will

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The testimony of
        these religious rules is of great importance: they not only convey to
        us the teaching of individuals remarkable for their piety and
        learning, but they moreover record for our instruction those
        disciplinary enactments which received the solemn sanction of the
        greatest saints of our ancient Church, and which guided in the paths
        of perfection thousands of our countrymen whose virtues and miracles
        won for our island a wide-spread fame for sanctity throughout the
        sixth and succeeding centuries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may now refer
        to facts connected with these sainted fathers of our Church which
        throw much light on the practice of confession, from the earliest
        period of faith in our island. Thus, of St. Adamnan we read that,
        being troubled about some sin of his early youth <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“he resorted to a priest from whom he hoped to learn the
        way of salvation, and confessing his fault <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a name="Pg484" id="Pg484" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> prayed for such counsel as might enable him to
        flee from the avenging anger of God”</span>.<a id="noteref_26" name=
        "noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the life of St.
        Columba, too, it is recorded that one day an Irishman from Connaught,
        by name Ildran, landed on the beach of Iona and proceeded to the
        guest-house of the monastery. On the following morning he made known
        to the saint the object of his journey, viz.: to do penance for his
        sins, and <span class="tei tei-q">“at the same hour he confessed all
        his sins and promised to fulfil the laws of penance”</span>.<a id=
        "noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> On
        another occasion St. Columba was visited by a person named Fiachna,
        who, being touched with remorse for some crime, fell at the saint's
        feet and <span class="tei tei-q">“confessed his sins before all that
        were there present”</span>, whereupon the holy man weeping embraced
        him, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Arise, my son, and be
        comforted; thy sins are forgiven thee, for, as it is written, the
        contrite and humble heart God doth not despise”</span>.<a id=
        "noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the case of a
        chieftain named Suibhne, it is mentioned that, though truly penitent,
        he was ordered by St. Pulcherius to confess his sins.<a id=
        "noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> We find
        also St. Maidoc of Ferns earnestly soliciting to have a wise
        confessor divinely destined for his guidance. St. Molua of
        Clonfert-molua was the person chosen by him, and hence, amongst other
        titles given to this last-named saint, is <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Father of the Confession of Maidoc”</span>.<a id=
        "noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> Again,
        in the life of St. Finbar it is mentioned that a young man from
        Leinster went to Iona to be guided by Columba: being obliged soon
        after to return to his native country, he thus affectionately
        addressed the holy abbot: <span class="tei tei-q">“O sancte Dei!
        quomodo in patria mea vivam et tibi confitear peccata
        mea?”</span><a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Martyrology

        is styled the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        the middle of the seventh century is venerated as patron of Peronne
        in France (pag. 40, I.A.S., 1865). In the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Felire</span></span> of
        Aenghus, St. Donnan of Eigg is also said to have gone to St.
        Columcille <span class="tei tei-q">“to make him his soul's
        friend”</span> (Reeves' <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        Redeemer himself by St. Aileran, in the beautiful prayer printed in

        id="page485">[pg 485]</span><a name="Pg485" id="Pg485" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> pag. 64, and, as we have already said, was the
        name given by the faithful in our early Church to those who in the
        Latin records are styled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Confessarii</span></span>, or <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patres
        Confessionis</span></span>. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Book of Fenagh</span></span> in one of its most
        ancient records states, that <span class="tei tei-q">“Columba plus
        venit ad S. Kilianum et ei confessus est peccata sua”</span> (I.A.S.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Miscellany</span></span>, vol. i., pag. 118). Of
        St. Finbarr it is also recorded that, on the death of his spiritual
        director, he went to St. Olan to make him <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">patrem confessionis suae</span></span>, or at
        least to be directed by him as to the person whom he should select;
        and the legend adds that St. Olan replied: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Christ Himself will be your confessor, and He will
        receive your hand”</span>; meaning, probably, that the hour of his
        death was come, for the next fact mentioned in St. Finbarr's life is
        his happy passage to eternity (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Life of St. Finbarr</span></span>, edited by R.
        Caulfield. London, 1864, pag. 21).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Probus, in the
        life of our great Apostle (chap. 20), mentions that one of the chief
        petitions which he made to God, during the time of his penitential
        retirement on Croaghpatrick, was: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ut
        unusquisque homo fidelis Hibernorum per poenitentiam et confessionem
        Deo satisfaciens licet in extremo vitae suae spatio, ab ipso
        elementer suscipiatur”</span>. It was to become sharer of this great
        privilege that St. Cormac, Bishop and King of Cashel, baying foretold
        his death, summoned to him St. Macsuach, Abbot of Castledermot, to
        whom he made his confession, and received from his hands the holy
        sacrament of the Eucharist. (I.A.S. 1860. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Annals</span></span>,
        pag. 203).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The confession
        even of venial faults was especially dwelt upon by St. Molua. One of
        his religious was negligent on this head, and St. Molua took occasion
        to correct him by his own example. As they were journeying together
        on a certain day, St. Molua said to him: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Peccavi vere hodie quia confessionem alicui seniori non
        feci de his quae egi hodie: me igitur hic sustine modicum donec vadam
        illuc et confitear”</span>. The religious was struck with terror, and
        asked <span class="tei tei-q">“would it not suffice to confess these
        sins to God alone?”</span> but the saint replied that unless we
        confess even our venial transgressions, we can only obtain pardon for
        them by severe penitential deeds here and hereafter, and added the
        well-known illustration: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sicut pavimentum
        domus scopâ quotidie tergitur, ita anima quotidianâ
        confessione”</span>. The ancient life concludes; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hoc audiens monachus a suo sancto Abbate, promisit
        confiteri sua offendicula; et confitebatur fideliter, et sanatus est
        ille frater a sua praeterita audacia”</span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vita ex Vet. Cod.
        Armac.</span></span>, edited by Fleming, cap. 32.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is only one
        document to which the enemies of our holy faith can appeal as
        evidencing a disregard for the sacrament of penance in our early
        Church: it is a letter of Alcuin, addressed, in the text of Canisius,
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">dilectissimis viris fratribus et patribus</span>
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page486">[pg 486]</span><a name="Pg486"
        id="Pg486" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in provincia Scotorum</span></span>, in which he
        mentions the rumour which had reached him, that the laity had refused
        <span class="tei tei-q">“confessionem sacerdotibus dare”</span>. Here
        (writes Dean Murray) is a clear rejection of Popery. However,
        antiquarians have long since decided that this text has no reference
        to sacramental confession (see Lanigan, iv. 67): and as the good
        Protestant dean had given his citation from Usher, he should have
        added that in Usher's opinion the title of this letter of Alcuin was
        erroneous, and that it was addressed to some faithful quite distinct
        from our old Celtic forefathers. This opinion no longer admits of any
        doubt. Canisius himself remarked <span class="tei tei-q">“that in the
        MS. from which he published this letter, it was addressed
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de
        dilectissimis, etc. in provincia Gothorum</span></span>”</span>, and
        he merely substituted the word <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Scotorum</span></span>, as a conjecture, not
        knowing that there were any people in the days of Alcuin who still
        retained the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Gothic</span></span>. Later discoveries,
        however, have proved that the very province of Languedoc, in which
        territory Alcuin lived for a long time, was designated by this name.
        The learned Quercetanus discovered a letter of Alcuin himself (ep.
        99), addressed to the faithful <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang=
        "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in diversis Gothiae
        partibus</span></span>”</span>; and Baluzius, in his <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Miscellanea</span></span> (i. 377), published
        another letter of the same Alcuin, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">iis qui sunt in Gothiae
        partibus</span></span>”</span>. The errors of Felix Urgellitanus,
        which are here referred to, fix more and more the district to which
        this letter was addressed; for whilst they had begun to creep in
        amongst the faithful of France, they were wholly unheard of in the
        Island of Saints.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all the
          habits of social life many of the early English settlers in Ireland
          soon became more Irish than the Irish themselves. In the vigorous
          tenacity of their attachment to the Catholic religion some of these
          families have ever remained as Irish as the Irish themselves.
          Having made our people their people, they became sharers in our
          grace of faith, so as to keep ever since our God their God. To the
          Talbots and the Plunkets we owe two <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          prominently even among the illustrious band of prelates who fought
          the good fight in the days of the persecutors. And as our Church
          reckons Anglo-Irish bishops among her martyrs, so among her doctors
          who guarded and enriched the sacred deposit of faith we may count
          Anglo-Irish prelates equally illustrious: and of these the subject
          of the present notice offers a distinguished example. A variety of
          great qualities, rarely united in one individual, gives a singular
          attractiveness to the history of Richard Fitz-Ralph, Archbishop of
          Armagh. Extraordinary holiness of life—of which proof remains not
          only in the popular couplet at the head of this paper, and in the
          appellation of St. Richard of Dundalk, by which he was known for
          centuries, but in the stronger evidence of a Pontifical commission
          issued by Boniface IX. to examine into his miracles with a view to
          his canonization;—rare intellectual power exhibited in every branch
          of theology—erudition both various and profound—eloquence of a high
          order, to which his sermons still extant bear testimony; all these
          are qualities which, especially when exercised under the trying
          vicissitudes of a great controversy within the Church, could not
          fail to constitute a remarkable career. Of this career we now
          propose to lay before our readers an outline as perfect as the
          materials within our reach will allow us to sketch. We do so with
          the hope that others, in whom better skill is backed by richer
          materials, may be led to supplement from their store our slender
          contribution to the history of an illustrious successor of St.
          Patrick.</p>

          Richard's Parentage.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ralph, founder
          of the Fitz-Ralph family, held forty-nine lordships in England in
          the reign of William the Conqueror. From this stem various branches
          issued, and several families of Fitz-Ralphs were to be found in the
          twelfth and thirteenth centuries. To which of these Richard belongs
          is a matter of uncertainty. Prince, in his anxiety to enrol him
          among the worthies of Devonshire, refers him to the Fitz-Ralphs of
          Widecomb in the Moor, who, about the time of Edward I., changed
          their names and residence, henceforth calling themselves
          Stillingford, from their new abode near Exeter. But this is mere
          guess work. It is far more probable, in our opinion, that he
          belonged to the Derbyshire Fitz-Ralphs, of which family the
          Frechevilles and Musards of Staveley<a id="noteref_33" name=
          "noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> became
          in after times the representatives. Our reasons are these. Ralph
          (Musard) Baron Staveley, a direct descendant of Ralph, the founder
          of the family, had a daughter Margaret, who, on his death, became
          co-heir with her brother <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page488">[pg
          488]</span><a name="Pg488" id="Pg488" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Nicholas and her sister Isabella. Margaret married an Irishman,
          named in the pedigree Joannes de Hibernia, and died in the year
          1308. Three children were born of this marriage—John de Hibernia,
          Ralph, and Alicia. Thus, we actually have the heir of the
          Fitz-Ralphs born of an Irish father. As his mother's heir John de
          Hibernia was owner of the third part of the manor of Staveley, and
          this property he gave and granted to Ralph de Frecheville, The
          evidence taken at an inquisition held at Staveley, in 1316, asserts
          that the said John <span class="tei tei-q">“had no other lands in
          England”</span>. This would lead us to conjecture that he had lands
          in Ireland, and after this time the pedigree no longer adds the
          words <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de
          Hibernia</span></span> to any of the Fitz-Ralphs. Now, it is
          certain that Richard must have been born about this time; and
          although the precise year of his birth is not known, the date of
          his promotion to Armagh would allow him to have been the son of
          this John, or of his brother Ralph. But, setting conjecture aside,
          one thing is proved beyond a doubt, viz., that about the time of
          Richard's birth the Fitz-Ralphs of Staveley had a close connection
          with Ireland.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An almost
          universal tradition fixes his birthplace at Dundalk. According to
          Wadding, the tradition was, that his parents came to Dundalk from
          the well known territory in the north of Ireland, called
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ruta</span></span>, or the Route. Wood states
          that almost all writers—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">auctores pene
          omnes</span></span>—make him an Irishman. This tradition is also
          clearly expressed in the appellation of Richard of Dundalk, by
          which he was universally known. It was the custom of the age to
          designate men by the name of their native place. Of this we have an
          excellent example in the name of John Baconthorpius, or of
          Baconthorpe, who, as we shall see, was Fitz-Ralph's professor at
          Oxford. Cotton, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Fasti</span></span>, tells us that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it has been contended, with some
          appearance of truth, that this prelate was born in England”</span>.
          He here alludes to the opinion maintained by Rev. John
          Prince,<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href=
          "#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> who
          considers it probable that our prelate was born in Devonshire,
          adding, <span class="tei tei-q">“some tell us, that he was an
          Irishman, and born in the town of Dundalk in that kingdom, and
          hence called by the name of Richard of Dundalk. Whereas, it is
          possible he might be so denominated, not from his birth, but from
          his long residence, or his doing some eminent exploit there, or
          from some other like occasion there. Others say he was an
          Englishman, which is not improbable, for these reasons: that he had
          his education at Oxford; that he was chosen commissary of that
          university; that he was made archdeacon of Lichfield; and that he
          was encouraged against the friars by English
          bishops”</span>.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page489">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are the
          only arguments alleged to prove that Archbishop Fitz-Ralph was born
          in England. They are of no weight whatever when compared with the
          mass of testimony on the other side. 1.—The name of Richard of
          Dundalk could not have arisen from the primate's long residence in
          that town, for he resided in his diocese only for about nine years,
          and certainly did not spend all his time in Dundalk. 2.—Nor is it
          told in history that he performed any eminent exploit here. 3.—It
          does not make against the Irish origin of Archbishop Fitz-Ralph
          that he had his education at Oxford. It is well known that at the
          beginning of the fourteenth century there were very many Irishmen
          at Oxford. Bale gives the names of several most distinguished
          Irishmen who flourished there at that period—in 1310, Malachias
          Minorita; in 1320, David O'Buge of Kildare; in 1330, Gilbert
          Urgalius, who, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">consueto Hibernorum hominum
          more</span></span>, went to Oxford after completing his rudimentary
          studies. Besides, among the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nations</span></em> whose contests in the
          thirteenth and fourteenth centuries so often made Oxford anything
          but a quiet abode of learning, the Irish had their place and
          generally went with the Southernmen. And the Archbishop himself, in
          his discourse at Avignon, relates how he had sent to Oxford four
          priests of the diocese of Armagh. 4.—That the appointment of
          Richard as chancellor or vice-chancellor of Oxford does not
          necessarily suppose him to have been an Englishman, will appear
          from what we have to say farther on concerning this office. 5—Nor
          was it strange that an Irish ecclesiastic should hold benefices in
          England. Clement VI., in 1351, granted to John de Briane, Dean of
          St. Patrick's at Dublin, who held at the same time the parish of
          Hatfield in Lincoln, permission to retain his benefices during his
          five years' course at a University.<a id="noteref_35" name=
          "noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Summing up the
          evidence, we have, on the one hand, the almost universal tradition
          that our prelate was born in Dundalk; we have an established
          connexion between the Derbyshire Fitz-Ralphs and Ireland about the
          time of his birth. On the other hand, against his Irish origin, we
          have no argument stronger than mere probabilities, which, when
          examined, are found to have no substance. We conclude, therefore,
          that Richard Fitz-Ralph was born in Dundalk. This conclusion
          receives some confirmation from a narrative in Fox,<a id=
          "noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> where
          we are told that a copy of the entire Bible, translated into Irish
          by Archbishop Fitz-Ralph, was found, many years after his death, in
          the walls of his cathedral. Now, if this story be true, and it is
          indirectly confirmed by Usher, it is plain that the Archbishop must
          have been born in Ireland. It is hard to believe that nine years,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page490">[pg 490]</span><a name=
          "Pg490" id="Pg490" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> broken as they were
          by provincial visitations and other labours, would have been
          sufficient to make an English prelate master of a language so
          difficult as the Irish, and that to the degree of perfection
          requisite for a translation of the sacred text.</p>

          Career.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Richard
          Fitz-Ralph went to Oxford, and was entered of Balliol College (then
          recently founded), where he remained until he had taken his degree
          of Master of Arts. The statutes in force at that time required him
          to leave Balliol. As soon as he received his degree in Arts, he
          accordingly passed to what is now known as University College, but
          which after 1332 was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Magna Aula Universitatis</span></span>, and
          which owed its origin to the liberality of William de Durham, who
          dying in 1249, bequeathed a sum of money for the benefit of ten or
          twelve poor masters. By a decision of congregation in 1280, four
          masters, <span class="tei tei-q">“whoever might be considered
          fittest for promotion in Holy Church”</span>, were to be chosen to
          enjoy these funds, each master being entitled to fifty shillings
          sterling yearly for his maintenance. The same document enjoins that
          the abovementioned masters, living together, shall attend lectures
          on theology, and shall be able, at the same time, to hear lectures
          on the decrees and decretals. As to their way of living and
          learning, they shall behave as they are directed by some fit and
          experienced men appointed by the Chancellor.<a id="noteref_37"
          name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His residence at
          Balliol gave him special opportunities to become proficient in
          arts. The college had been endowed to enable sixteen scholars to
          study in arts, each scholar receiving a yearly revenue of
          twenty-seven marks. His residence in University College enabled him
          to cultivate theology. Thus all the materials of knowledge then
          existing were brought within his reach. At that date the course of
          studies had changed a good deal from the ancient narrow limits of
          the Trivium<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href=
          "#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          "#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> Out of
          the logic of the Trivium the new philosophy was developed, and the
          sciences of the Quadrivium became mere preparatory studies to the
          Facultas Artium.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href=
          "#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> It is
          mentioned by Tanner and others, that Richard Fitz-Ralph attended
          the theological lectures of the famous Carmelite John Baconthorpe.
          This remarkable man was one of the most illustrious scholars of the
          day, and exercised a powerful influence on the mind of his pupil.
          It has been observed, that when the latter had become Archbishop of
          Armagh, and had entered upon his controversy with the friars, he
          ever showed a marked affection for the Carmelites.</p><span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The early half
          of the fourteenth century was a season of much agitation in
          philosophical and theological opinions. The ancient struggle
          between the Nominalists and the Realists entered at this time upon
          a new phase. The Realism of St. Thomas of Aquin was opposed by the
          Nominalism of Occam, and Fitz-Ralph found Oxford still agitated by
          the controversies that master had excited. The Franciscans were
          generally Nominalists; the secular clergy, as a body, were
          Realists. The entire university was divided into two opposite
          camps. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Northern men”</span> declared
          for Realism, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Southern men”</span> for
          Nominalism.<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href=
          "#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>
          Fitz-Ralph became a leading Realist, and the marked divergence
          between his views and those of the Franciscans was probably not
          without its influence on the controversy to which hereafter we
          shall have occasion to refer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How deep and how
          extensive were the studies of Fitz-Ralph shall best be learned from
          the list of his works at the conclusion of this notice. It will be
          enough for our present purpose to state here, that his labours
          cover almost the entire field of Catholic controversy with the
          Greeks and Armenians, as well as (by anticipation) with the
          Reformers. A remarkable element in his writings, and one the
          presence of which reveals the form of scepticism current in his
          age, is the contribution he has made to the literature of the
          Christian Demonstration. He defends the Christian religion against
          the Jews by contrasting the sacraments and ceremonies of the New
          Law with those of the Jewish dispensation. This line of defence was
          called for by the altered method of attack which the Jews about the
          twelfth century began to employ against the Church. In the early
          ages the controversy turned upon the question whether our Lord was
          the Messiah. In the middle ages they had recourse to the scriptural
          defence of their own position, and calumnious attacks on
          Christianity. It is not strange that he should have combated
          Mahometanism. It should be borne in mind that the age of Frederic
          II. had witnessed the birth of a strange admiration for Mahometan
          literature; that Pope Gregory IX. had fought against this novel
          danger; that against the Arabian Averroes and his philosophy St.
          Thomas of Aquin himself had entered the lists. It is not surprising
          therefore that the archbishop's zeal urged him to provide a remedy
          for the evil by proving that the Saracenic law itself confirmed the
          authority of the books of the Old and New Testament.</p>

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Oxford University in 1333. On the other
          hand, Wood asserts in his history that no record of this
          chancellorship exists either in the University or the Episcopal
          archives. However, the same Wood admits him to have been
          Commissarius of the university in that year, or, as we may describe
          it, vice-chancellor. Is there any way by which these different
          statements may be reconciled? It appears to us that an attentive
          consideration of the various phases through which the office of
          chancellor of Oxford has passed will supply a very probable
          solution of the difficulty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First of all, we
          must bear in mind that Oxford was not at that time the seat of a
          bishop, but was included within the diocese of Lincoln. Next, we
          should consider that even during the course of the fourteenth
          century the chancellor was an episcopal officer, not an academical
          one; he represented the ordinary of the diocese, and from him drew
          all his jurisdiction and authority. As the university grew in
          importance and extent, the position of the chancellor, as a power
          extern to the university, became untenable, and by degrees, the
          nomination to the office passed from the hands of the bishop to
          those of the academicians.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43"
          href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> For a
          time the bishop struggled to retain at least the right of
          confirming the election, but in the course of the fourteenth
          century even this claim was abandoned. The period 1300-1350 forms,
          therefore, a peculiar epoch in the history of the Oxford
          chancellors, marking as it does the transition period between the
          chancellors who were episcopal officers, and the chancellors
          elected by and out of the university. Now this transition was not
          effected suddenly, but almost by way of compromise: there was no
          sharp separation between the two classes of chancellors; the one
          gradually merged into the other. We should therefore expect to find
          some confusion in the list of chancellors; the bishop's chancellor
          being considered as the legitimate chancellor by those who sided
          with the bishop, whereas the academicians would naturally look up
          to their own nominee. Now it is quite certain that Richard
          Fitz-Ralph, master of theology, was appointed Chancellor of Lincoln
          on the 6th of July, 1333, for the appointment is entered under that
          date on the register of Bishop Burghers. We may conclude,
          therefore, either that as Chancellor of Lincoln he was Chancellor
          of the University, as the episcopal officers before him had been,
          or that his appointment having fallen upon a time of some dispute
          about the nomination of the chancellor, he was styled <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">commissarius</span></span> only, or that the
          story of his Oxford chancellorship took its rise from the fact that
          he was chancellor of the bishop in whose diocese Oxford was
          situated. According to some authors, he was also Archdeacon of
          Chester. But he was certainly Dean of Lichfield, at least from
          1337, and held this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page493">[pg

          office until his appointment to Armagh. Wood relates that shortly
          before his own time the first window on the northern side of the
          choir of Lichfield cathedral contained a picture of Richard
          Fitz-Ralph clothed in his sacerdotal vestments, and above the

        "font-size: 90%">The pious and innumerable pilgrimages of the
        faithful this year are a pledge of great fervour; for, like bees to
        the beehive, so do they daily flock in such numbers from every corner
        of the kingdom, for penitential purposes, to a certain island, which
        is called the Purgatory of St. Patrick, and which is situated in the
        centre of a lake, that many have been obliged to return without
        satisfying their pious desire, there being no room for landing on the
        island. This pilgrimage, though, through the bitter persecutions of
        heresy, it has been almost abandoned for many years, was once so
        celebrated throughout the Christian world, that many from the most
        distant parts even of the continent visited it in a spirit of
        devotion. The manner of performing the pilgrimage as it is now
        observed from ancient tradition, is as follows:—Each person, from the
        day he arrives in the island till the tenth following day, never
        departs from it. All this time is, without intermission, devoted to
        fasting, watching, and prayer. If they wish to give rest to their
        body they must sleep on the bare ground, and for the most part under
        the broad canopy of heaven. They receive but one refection, and that
        consists of bread and water. It is incredible what severe austerities
        and bodily mortifications females, as well as men, and persons of
        every age and of every condition, endure, whilst they perform this
        penitential course; and during twenty-four hours they are shut up in
        certain caves, like unto prisons, where they pass the whole day and
        night entirely absorbed in prayer, and receiving nothing to eat or to
        drink.</span></span></p>

          pilgrim was first conducted barefooted to the church of St.

          seven times outside, repeating all the while stated prayers of the
          Church. He was then conducted to the seven places of station, known

          formerly small churches, or sanctuaries, dedicated to various
          saints; and at each of these he repeated the visit as above. The
          next station was around a cross in the cemetery, and subsequently
          at another cross that was fixed in a mound of stones. Thence he
          proceeded,</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          border of the lake, to which tradition pointed as the place on
          which St. Patrick had knelt in prayer. Here, also, certain prayers
          were appointed to be recited. All this pilgrimage and prayer was
          repeated three times each day—morning, noon, and evening—during the
          first seven days; on the eighth day it was repeated six times;
          confession and communion followed on the morning of the ninth day;
          and then the pilgrims entered the cave, where twenty-four hours
          were devoted to fasting and meditation. Any that choose not to

          inhabitants of Ireland a chosen retreat of prayer and penance, its
          fame on the continent assumed another form. With the troubadours it
          became a favourite theme. Calderon immortalized it in Spanish; in
          Italy, it attracted the attention of Dante and Ariosto; and many
          popular tales about St. Patrick's Purgatory are still extant in
          French and Portuguese. It thus became a matter of romance; and
          poetical imagination conducted the penitents who visited the Island
          of Lough Derg, at first to the regions of Purgatory, and
          subsequently to the abodes of the blessed or of the
          damned.</span></span></p>

          Protestant writers seized on these poetic tales as if they were
          matters of sober fact, and availed themselves of the fictions of
          romance to cast ridicule on the practices of Catholic piety and
          devotion. For some time, indeed, they did not dare to offer
          violence to the pilgrims, who hastened thither with unabated
          fervour. During the reign of James I., however, the chapels or
          oratories on the island were demolished; but this did not satisfy
          the fury with which the enemies of the Catholic faith assailed its
          sanctuaries and shrines. Enraged at the numbers who, despite their
          threats, continued to flock to this penitential retreat, the lords
          justices, in 1632, made a last effort to desecrate</span>

          After publicly announcing that, in the opinion of the Papists,
          there was a passage from this island to the other world, and an
          entrance to the realms of Purgatory, they gave orders to have the
          whole island dug up, and that especially no portion of the cave
          should remain undestroyed; and thus, says Dr. Mant, was made

          knees over the rough rock fragments, which struck one with horror,
          not to speak of the danger of yawning chasms and precipices; but
          often, too, did he go into Ulster, to the far-famed</span>

          pilgrims are wont to abstain from meat for nine days, using no
          food, save a little bread, and water from the lake. During one of
          the nine days, they are shut up in the dismal darkness of a cavern,
          and, therein fasting, partake of nothing save a little water, to
          moisten their throats when parched with thirst. At noontide and
          evening, they go on bended knees over paths beaten by the feet of
          saints, and strewn with sharp stones. In other quarters, they walk
          barefooted over rugged ways, in the olden time frequented by holy
          men, to satisfy for their transgressions. Sometimes walking and
          sometimes on their knees, they advance to a considerable distance
          into the sea. Thus do they spend the day, pouring out their prayers
          to God, and listening to holy discourses; nor in this sacred place
          is there to be seen or heard anything scurrilous or ludicrous. When
          night comes on, they lie down, not to enjoy repose, but to snatch a
          few moments' sleep; their beds are of straw, nor do they use any
          pillow but their garments. Thrice each day did Francis, with the
          other pilgrims, punctually perform these duties, and, in addition,
          he diligently applied himself to hearing confessions and preaching

          the Purgatory of St. Patrick the theme of one of his homilies to

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is evident from
        this decree that the vestments are not to be worn at the office of
        the dead, for they are not allowed even in a case which would appear
        one of necessity, viz.: when there is only one priest present, and
        when some delay must necessarily occur between the office and the
        mass, if the celebrant must wait to say the prayer at the end of
        Lauds before he puts on the vestments. If in such an extreme case,
        when there arises some delay between the office and mass, which is
        most objectionable and always to be avoided in ceremonies, the alb
        and cincture cannot be worn, they cannot surely be used on ordinary
        occasions when such necessity does not exist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. With regard to
        the second question, the Roman Ritual does not prescribe even the use
        of a stole or of a cope, as far as we are aware, and we think that
        the practice of not wearing one or the other at the office is the
        most correct and to be recommended, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page501">[pg 501]</span><a name="Pg501" id="Pg501" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> though we are well aware that the contrary
        practice is adopted by many. The Roman Ritual, treating of the
        procession in which the remains are carried to the church, has the
        following words:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But these words do
        not apply to the office. The Caeremoniale Episcoporum, treating of
        the ceremony on All Souls' Day, does make mention of the stole and
        cope (book ii., chap. 10, n. 10):</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“An in officio defunctorum celebrans inducre
        debeat stolam vel saltem possit, uti erui posse videtur ex

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
        decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites referring to this
        matter:—</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

        sequuntur? Saltem si in hac Functione utatur Pluviali, quum in eo

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may observe
        that a direct answer is not given to the question, which was proposed
        with the view of ascertaining what should be done in two special
        cases, and the only answer given was <span class="tei tei-q">“in
        utroque casu licere”</span>. Hence a priest might wear the stole and
        cope, but should he not do so, he would not follow a course at
        variance with this decree. No doubt, in some rubrical works, express
        mention is made of the stole and cope, and still more frequently of
        one or the other; but the Roman Ritual, as we said, does not
        prescribe either at the office of the dead, and when their use is
        pointed out, it generally refers to the cathedral churches, where the
        ceremonies are carried out with greater pomp and solemnity, than in
        those rural churches to which our correspondent refers. We may also
        observe that the decree above quoted, does not contemplate the use of
        the stole and cope apart from the procession. On the whole,
        considering the circumstances of our churches, we would in practice
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page502">[pg 502]</span><a name="Pg502"
        id="Pg502" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dispense with stole and cope
        at the office, while we would be slow to condemn the use of the cope,
        if such a custom existed in any church that in other respects carried
        out the ceremonies of the Church with accuracy and decorum. But we
        consider that the decree of 7th September, 1850, above quoted,
        clearly lays down that the stole ought not to be used, though we find
        it more frequently used on such occasions than the cope, on the
        ground, perhaps, that it is an emblem of jurisdiction in the person
        who presides.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. In reply to the
        third question, we beg to say that the Mass should commence
        immediately at the end of the lauds, which terminate with the prayer,
        and after the prayer, the Requiem aeternam, etc., and Requiescant in
        pace should not be said: it is only when the ceremony concludes that
        these are to be said.</p>

        build his discourse with ease and advantage. And yet, though the
        materials are placed ready to his hand, the work will still be all
        his own. The author does not undertake to supersede labour, but to
        lighten the preacher's fatigue by lending his friendly help. He
        supplies matter for the discourse, he even traces the outline of its
        form, and then leaves to the preacher himself the task of
        construction. In the opening pages he addresses himself to the
        question, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">how is a priest, especially a young priest, to
        render himself a useful and even a perfect preacher of the Word of
        God?</span></span> In <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page504">[pg
        504]</span><a name="Pg504" id="Pg504" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        answer to this question, he touches in a masterly way on these two
        points, 1. What is a preacher of the Gospel, and what is the
        perfection that belongs to him? 2. By what process may a preacher
        attain to this perfection? Part of this process consists, of course,
        in the preparation of the sermon, and it is to facilitate this
        preparation that the work before us has been compiled. The author
        reduces to fifty heads the entire cycle of subjects suited for
        pastoral exhortation, embracing in this number whatever can serve to
        bring the sinner to justification, to guide him in the path of a
        Christian life, and to conduct him to Heaven. He gives on each of
        these fifty subjects a treatise which is a marvel of brevity and
        fulness. So judicious is the arrangement of the texts bearing on the
        subject; so clear and full the statement of the case; so simple the
        division of the arguments, that each of these little treatises makes
        the reader complete master of the subject of which it treats. On the
        more important subjects, and on those which require more frequent
        handling, the author supplies many and different divisions or
        outlines of sermons, thus guarding against the monotony that arises
        when a subject is presented often under the same form. One other
        merit we would signalise in this work. It deals with the wants,
        defects, and vices of the men of our own times. The books of sermons
        which are to be found on the shelves of the clergy generally belong
        to an extinct period; the exhortations they contain are coloured by
        circumstances that have long ceased to exist. Modern modes of
        thought, modern manners, modern literature, have given rise to a
        peculiar class of temptations and of dangers, and as these differ
        quite from those of a century ago, so also do they demand peculiar
        treatment and special remedies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Father Schouppe
        has not forgotten this, and takes care to grapple with the
        difficulties that beset the Christian life of the nineteenth century.
        Two indexes close the volume. One exhibits a general synopsis of the
        contents; the other refers to the various passages whence materials
        may be drawn for a sermon appropriate to the gospel of each Sunday
        and holiday in the year. Both indexes enhance the practical value of
        this excellent book, which we do not hesitate to call a real boon for

        Settlement of Ireland.</span></span> By John P. Prendergast, Esq.
        London: Longmans, 1865.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is a valuable
        accession to Irish history. It gives an account of the cruelties
        practised on our people in the Cromwellian Confiscations. It
        confirms, from official sources, the painful details contained in Dr.
        Moran's lately published sketch of the persecutions of the Irish
        Catholics in the seventeenth century. The Irish land question cannot
        be well understood without the aid of Mr. Prendergast's excellent
        book.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is singular
            that the sufferings of Irish Catholics should meet with more
            sympathy from an English Protestant clergyman than from an Irish
            Catholic lecturer. The relations between our country and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“our glorious deliverer”</span> are thus
            described by the Rev. Sidney Smith:—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The war carried on in Ireland against King William
            cannot deserve the name of a rebellion: it was a struggle for
            their lawful prince, whom they had sworn to maintain, and whose
            zeal for the Catholic religion, whatever effect it might have
            produced in England, could not by them be considered as a crime.
            This war was terminated by the surrender of Limerick, upon
            conditions by which the Catholics hoped, and very rationally
            hoped, to secure to themselves the free enjoyment of their
            religion in future, and an exemption from all those civil
            penalties and incapacities which the reigning creed is so fond of
            heaping upon its subjugated rivals.</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“By the various articles of this treaty, they are to
            enjoy such privileges in the exercise of their religion as they
            did enjoy in the time of Charles II.; and the king promises, upon
            the meeting of parliament, <span class="tei tei-q">‘to endeavour
            to procure for them such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            particular as may preserve them <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from any
            disturbance</span></em> on account of their said
            religion’</span>. They are to be restored to their estates,
            privileges, and immunities, as they enjoyed them in the time of
            Charles II. The gentlemen are to be allowed to carry arms; and no
            other oath is to be tendered to the Catholics who submit to King
            William than the oath of allegiance. These and other articles
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">King
            William ratifies for himself, his heirs and successors, as far as
            in him lies, and confirms the same, and every other clause and
            matter therein contained</span></em>.</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“These articles were signed by the English general on
            the 3rd of October, 1691; and diffused comfort, confidence, and
            tranquillity among the Catholics. On the 22nd of October, the
            English parliament excluded Catholics from the Irish Houses of
            Lords and Commons, by compelling them to take the oaths of
            supremacy before admission.</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“In 1695, the Catholics <em class=

            abroad</span></em>, and of the privilege of being guardians to
            their own or to other persons' children. Then all the Catholics
            were disarmed, and then <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          ultra genua excedentibus obtegitur, donec nona die, pracmissa
          generali confessione, omnibus vitae noxis expiatis, sacro pabulo
          refecti ante diluculum ingrediuntur subterraneam foveam quae
          purgatorium dicitur, ibique viginti quatuor horis continuis semper
          vigiles et orantes sine ullo cibi aut potus refrigerio perseverant
          et recurrente eadem hora egressi sequenti die se ter immergunt
          algidis aquis sicque perficitur peregrinatio cui otiosi fabularum

              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
